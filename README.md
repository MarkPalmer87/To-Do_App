**Welcome to Mark Palmer's To-Do-List React Application.**

This application was created with React, and Redux and is intended to demonstrate usage of react components, and managing state changes for the application. 

The application will allow users to add tasks to the to-do list, toggle them as either complete or incomplete, and remove tasks. Additional navigation links are 
included to: Contact, Login, and Account pages. 

User Stories – To-do List App:
User Story #1 – Frank
As a dad, I am a user of many apps, but I have so many tasks and items all over many different applications. I would like a simple interface, no frills, task management application. So that I can be sure not to miss any more appointments, and stay on top of my day. 
User Story #2 – Dan
I am a student, studying finance at Vanderbilt university, I have a lot of books and papers to lug around, and my paper to-do-lists tend to keep getting lost as I move from class to class. I would like an application that allows me to keep track of which classes and homework assignments I need to stay on top of, while also allowing me to be aware of which assignments I’ve already completed. 
User Story #3 – Clara
I run a restaurant, and my associate always forgets items when he goes to pick up the groceries for the week. I need an app that will allow us to add items to the grocery list, where everyone can see them, and to keep them on after they’re checked off until the end of each work day for inventory purposes. 


Wireframes are also provided in the GitHub repository for this application, as well as quick reference screenshots of the wireframes for ease of access.
